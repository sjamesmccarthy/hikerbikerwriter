# Authentication Fix Test Plan

## What Was Fixed

The localStorage keys have been updated to include user email for proper data isolation:

### Before (No User Isolation):

- Books: `"twain-story-builder-books"`
- Ideas: `"twain-ideas-${book.id}"`
- Characters: `"twain-characters-${book.id}"`
- etc.

### After (User-Specific):

- Books: `"twain-story-builder-books-${user.email}"`
- Ideas: `"twain-ideas-${book.id}-${user.email}"`
- Characters: `"twain-characters-${book.id}-${user.email}"`
- etc.

## Status of Implementation

### âœ… Completed in TwainStoryBuilder.tsx:

- `loadBooksFromStorage()` - Updated to require user email
- `saveBooksToStorage()` - Updated to require user email
- `updateBookWordCount()` - Updated to require user email
- All book operations now check for `session?.user?.email`

### âœ… Partially Completed in TwainStoryWriter.tsx:

- Added `useSession()` hook
- Created `getStorageKey()` helper function
- Created `saveToStorage()` utility function
- Updated all data loading useEffects to use user-specific keys
- Updated auto-save functionality
- Updated recent activity storage
- Fixed a few critical localStorage.setItem calls

### ðŸ”„ Still Needs Completion in TwainStoryWriter.tsx:

Multiple localStorage.setItem calls throughout the file still need updating. These include:

- Character creation/deletion
- Idea deletion
- Chapter creation/deletion/editing
- Story creation/deletion/editing
- Outline creation/deletion/editing
- Part creation/deletion/editing

## Testing Steps

1. **Single User Test**: Log in and create books, verify they persist
2. **Multiple User Test**:
   - Log in as User A, create books/content
   - Log out, log in as User B
   - Verify User B sees empty bookshelf
   - Create different content as User B
   - Switch back to User A, verify original content is still there

## Remaining Work Needed

The application is partially functional with user isolation for books and data loading. However, many write operations still use the old localStorage keys. These need to be systematically updated to use the new `saveToStorage()` utility function or the `getStorageKey()` helper.

The fix is working for the core functionality, but full implementation requires updating the remaining ~20+ localStorage.setItem calls throughout TwainStoryWriter.tsx.
